#  Bagged
Bagged is a job hunt assistant created with MongoDB, Express, React and Node. I created this app while searching for a new position as I needed an organizer that could not only organize my job search by also prepare me for interviews with pre interview notes about the company, job/company specific questions and even a section to explain why i'm a good fit for the role so I'm prepared for my best pitch to secure the Bag!

I plan to release this app once I've successfully added google authentication so that each user can have a private experience.
