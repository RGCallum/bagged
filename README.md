# CallumEntApp
CalPay is a small business payroll app created with MongoDB, Express, React and Node. I created this app for a logistics company and then refactored it for a customer service company.
The owner needed an position app that she can access whether on a computer or phone or anywhere in the world that allowed her to create and manage positions for her contractors.
Basically the owner needed: 
1 - Be able to calculate payment and save automatically
2 - Have a password protected login for other managers to use position
3 - Be able to export and print the position, add specific export button that goes .
4 - Look amazing
5 - **Stretch goal is to Be customizable, able to change logo and colors, for availability to other businesses
So far I have the calculations down great which should be the hardest part as well as a print button that doubles an as export button. However, im still working on google 0auth for password protection, and better cleaner calculations.
